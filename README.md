# PBC-ML-Predicting-Breast-Cancer-in-Humans-using-Machine-Learning-Approach

Cancer is a disease in which cells grow uncontrollably, potentially causing harm to
surrounding healthy tissue and organs. Breast cancer is a specific type of cancer that affects
the breast and is the second most common cancer among women worldwide. Symptoms of
breast cancer include a lump or tumour, swelling, nipple discharge, and swollen lymph
nodes. Breast cancer is staged, with stage 0 being the earliest stage with minimal symptoms
and stage 4 indicating the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. The future burden
of breast cancer is predicted to increase, with over 3 million new cases and 1 million deaths
in 2040. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment and recovery, and machine
learning can be used to predict the likelihood of breast cancer based on symptoms. So we
propose in our research to use machine learning algorithms such as CART, SVM, NB, and
KNN to analyse and build models for breast cancer detection. These findings offer a
summary of relevant machine learning methods for breast cancer detection as it will help to
curb it and we got an accuracy of 98.2% compared to the state of art methods which has
accuracy of 99%. It proves to be a valuable tool in the early detection of breast cancer and
can improve the accuracy of existing diagnostic methods
